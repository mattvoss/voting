In regards to the 2818/Holleman intersection I have been informed that during the construction of the 2818/Wellborn interchange TXDOT offered passthrough financing for the construction of an overpass at 2818/Holleman. Passthrough financing from what I was told is when TXDOT pays upfront for construction of a road and then a city pays them back over a specified period of time.

The City of College Station apparently turned down the offer for unspecified reasons.

As a sidenote I was also told that the Villa Maria overpass project required zero acquistion of land. All the right of way had already been acquired. The general feeling is that there is plenty of right of way for 2818 to be turned into a bypass highway but there is no political will to achieve this.

Oh and one more thing. The FM60 ramp realignment that is beginning next week on the 15th was slated to begin in the fall during football season. Obviously it has been moved up...

Finally I'd like to add I know absolutely nothing!
